# Generics

1. Design the Joiner<T> class, which in the constructor will take a **separator** (string)
and have a **join()** method that allows you to specify any number of T-type objects.
This method will return a string joining all passed
elements by calling their toString() method 
nd separating them with a separator.

2. Restrict generic type to child of Number
